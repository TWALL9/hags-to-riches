# Henrizzle the airship abandoner
- as reality breaks down around the spectators, [[transmuter henry]] appears, to take them to his airship
- he leaves annith and [[audre]] to die on the arena floor?
- he gives kay, sal, crel a bunch of scrolls and the bendy stAnnithraw of reinvigoration
- Henry wants to split, he's taking the others with him, leaving [[Annith]] behind
- voidlings are following behind, eventually catching up with the airship
	- the spectators fight back, along with henry's gelatinous cube first mate
	- crelypsis manages to uppercut one
- the portal looks like it's getting stitched together

# [[Annith]] is stuck on the ground
- she's pinned under some kind of unspeakable bird monster
	- called a riftling
- tinker is also unhappy.  
	- he's lighting up some kind of tesla coil on his back 
	- but something's very, very wrong
- audre is freaking out
- There's a flash of light, and tinker appears to be functioning, but audre is knocked out
	- the loudspeaker on his head is ringing out, asking "remind me how you pilot this thing?"
	- audre is stuck inside of tinker
- audre begins figuring out how tinker works
	- figures out how to put up some kind of protective field around Annith and her own body

# here there be dragons
- The streetpaw's dog comes out to fight
	- he's surrounded by seven canaries
- after some struggling, suddenly there is a flash of bright light
	- suddenly a giant platinum dragon flies from the ground, followed by several gold dragons
	- the dog and canaries have transformed into bahamut
	- also apparently the streetpaws are bahamut
	- shit's gotten too weird for annith
- also [[dipika]]is a dragon somehow
- the dragons break the airship apart, but catch it?
	- the gelatinous cube first mate catches henry, but he splatters all over the ground, becoming a tiny gelatinous cube

# thanks, you too
- after all this nonsense, Annith finds audre is returned to normal, and tinker is reduced to a pile of broken parts on the ground ^195679
- apparently his powers are fueled by heroic emotions?
- the silpasha is granting us a *thing*, basically a wish within his power
	- we're using it to get [[salphonse's sister]]

# we all need a beer
- find out that there's another sentient gelatinous geometric shape out there somewhere
-
