# heading to the quill ward
- WE GOT A QUEST
	- Throw money at stig the gladiator so she can buy her freedom
	- [[mahir]] owes her money, and you throw money at gladiators so they can buy their freedom
	- he gave us 1pp 10gp each to throw
- the library is in a massive temple of Azuth
	- like, it's massive and opulent

# stoned to the bone tours inc.
- We have a guide named [[adil]]
	- He was on the caravan with us, I smoked hookah with him
	- He's stoned to the bone, can't lead us anywhere
- we get stoned to the bone with him
	- too relaxed, feel like i'm losing my legs
	- notice symbols on the wall, not convinced they're the drugs
	- find a maze symbol, [[salphonse]] is also stoned and traces his finger on it
	- once it's solved, the maze becomes varying concentric circles,
	
# gettin learnt with ushan
- wake up in a nice bed/pile of blankets in a room with a single bell
	- [[crelypsis]] rings the bell and [[ushan the learned]] appears
	- he's a djinn
	- he takes us out into a room with 4 bottles/lamps
	- they must have djinns in them
	- he bound all of them, none of them are upset at him and don't want to harm him or others
	- seems like he got his powers from them, but in return for doing their bidding?
	- we were each to pick a bottle to get their wisdom
	- i picked one that looks like a salt lamp
- [[adil]] is ushan's brother

# dhabbu the grounded
- looks like ghanesh
- surrounded by a demiplane of pure opulence
- gave me a lot of nonsense advice
	- I asked about where I can find inspiration for a great work
	- he said that he can't predict the future
	- I asked about what he would do with the scrimshaw if he were in my shoes
	- he said that instead of trying to gain advantage over someone, he would give me a blessing so i would not have to worry about the stars
