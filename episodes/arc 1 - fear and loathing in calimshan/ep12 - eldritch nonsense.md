# the date night
- Annith foots the bill for her and [[audre]]'s dinner
- down to have another date

# we don't need instructions where we're going
- MEGA LASER doesn't have a known input, it appears to work at random
- up up down down left right left right b a start
- [[sam flam]]'s notes aren't complete, just movement and basic shooting
	- something about rocket boots (????) he doesn't know
- annith and audre head over to the arena
	- run into adil (guy who was stoned in the library)
	- that robot gave him bad vibes
		- a red aura and murder energy

# pre-drinks with henry
- crel, kay and sal also run into adil on their way over

# the fight night
- fighting THE SCARECROW
	- a mechanical scarecrow with no real legs (it floats?) and two mechanical ravens
- upon seeing this, tinker's hat opens up, and an antenna with a flashing light emerges.
	- in the distance, sirens
	- we do not know what this is
- the scarecrow has a cloak that seems to have bombs in it
- tinker doesn't have much purchase on actually hitting the scarecrow with his rifle, the scarecrow's body is actually very tiny under the cloak
- reach in to grab one of the bombs to use against it, but *something* explodes into a noxious gas
	- knocks everyone out, hallucinating?
	- kay sees bodies rolling down as a hill
		- some kind of cosmic altar
		- sees some emaciated bird creatures moaning atonally
		- kay falls prostrate, staring up at the dark sun altar, and a figure made of eyes offers her a merciful death (?)
	- sal sees a bunch of dragonborn mocking him for not being of their culture
		- holes explode in their chest, and he runs away, and sees a dark bridge in the fog
		- some crazy entity is following him on all fours
		- tries to taste the magic like he did with adil -> tastes like pure evil and illusion
		- sal tries to eat the creature that's following him (??)
		- 
	- crel is in a pitch black, tight space
		- tries to squeeze out of the space through a crack
		- something dark and wet grabs her leg
		- attempts to kick the creature off of her
		- fails, and the cold wet thing has pierced her thigh
	- annith sees audre slapping her awake
		- tinker and scarecrow are still fighting in the air autonomously
		- scarecrow does not have a visible (or at least awake) operator
		- it also is too small for a power supply that makes any sense
	- the sky is rending, with a strange song in the distance, growing louder
	- a giant birdlike creature lands in the stands and starts eating some of the audience
	- audre thinks that there must be several power supplies in it somewhere
		- definitely in its head
	- annith hands her spear to Tinker, her crossbow to Audre, and immediately catapults the rift-creature
- it's not looking good, eldritch nonsense is raining from the sky, people are dying in droves
- a hand impacts the stadium, connected to an arm that reaches all the way up to the sky rift
	- IT'S THE FUCKING CHAOS GENE
	- another hand reaches out to grab the chaos gene
		- it has a gauntlet
			- IT'S FUCKIN HULMAR GODDAMN SLATESHIELD
