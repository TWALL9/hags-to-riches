# gobs vs birb
* big goblin flesh construct vs dartwing
* dartwing is so tiny that the larger goblin flesh golem thing cannot hit it
* dartwing flies through it multiple times, big gory mess, very one sided

# main event time baby (aka psycho killer, q'est que c'est)
* fuck sham flam.  it's grudge match time
* oh never mind he's got a big fuckoff soviet bodyslammer
* flamethrowers for hands
* sam flam starts monologuing and tells annith how he's all alone in this world and didn't need nobody and how annith is the cause of all that
* annith asks him if he's done talking about how big of a piece of shit he is
* tinkertank has a giant giga ray cannon thing
	* targeted by a laser from sam flam
	* annith puts big brew between him and tinkertank to force him to miss
	* also uses water to disperse the laser, causing him to very closely miss
* this laser is way too powerful, can't be contained by magical field around the fight
* annith calls transmuter henry as ref basically asking "what the hell, ref, this thing is unsafe!"
* match gets cancelled, both annith and sam flam technically forfeit
* sam flam has basically turned into a psychopath, and i'm pretty sure he wants to kill annith at some point
	* audre has no idea where this came from, and we think to mail [[timonthy fuckin wall]] about this, since sam flam didn't bring him, and said that he's basically alone now

# the afterparty (aka gobby goth gf)
* we're all hanging out, with agnol ([[ep32 - robot rap battle aka will the real swim shady please stand up]])
	* agnol is annith's #1 fan, after audre of course
* we're basically wingmanning ib to get with styx (goblin necromancer from the goblin robot team)
*
