# back at the white lady
* for the festivities, everyone is given a little rock that lets them take on the appearance of someone else for the night
	* ib becomes Big Ib
	* sal gets a frilly neck
	* audre becomes a dragonborn
	* annith becomes a bear
	* crelypsis becomes a mermaid
* the next day we're visited by danneth waylen
	* speaker of easthaven
	* not a prick, just wants to be our friend

# "i also struggle with creativity"
- we start working on the float, with the help of Bobastair (new guy that I named)
- annith can't paint, but turns out crelypsis can
- Kay will fight ib on the float
- annith and audre will build some magical trinkets and souvenirs
- Sal will...do things...
- Yann shows up, offers to carve stuff for our float
	- since he's obviously done with [[ep09 - Yann and Yuan]]

# the long con
- the parade is designed to route through town square, and overall take about an hour
- everything is going great!  Except at one point...Ib stops following his queues after "dying" as part of the act
- suddenly, a robed figure jumps up on the float, a masked assassin from Calimshan
-
