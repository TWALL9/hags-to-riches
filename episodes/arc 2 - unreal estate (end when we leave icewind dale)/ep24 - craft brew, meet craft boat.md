- need to find something about what to do with this siren
- Annith gets the bright idea to fuse craft brew with a romantic fixer-upper dinghy rowboat
	- CRAFT BOAT
	![[craft-boat.png]](i'm not apologizing for this image)
* the rest of the crew tries to find the absolute saltiest fisherman in the place to get siren tales
	* John the Fisherman -> says that there are sirens with fins, and some that don't have fins
	* also that they get aggressive when they have babies
* There's a lot of debate about the ethics of siren personhood or whether they're people and by extension their babies.
	* aka how much guilt will we feel if we have to murder it, or can we re-locate it?  and how?
	
# the plan
- the plan is to go back out there and use craft boat as bait, since it can't be charmed by the siren's song.
- Once back out on the water, we learn that from skrappy (who's still out there on the water) that the siren is likely not alone (oh god it must have babies)
- crelypsis decides to get high on the water with the incense cube she got from ushan back in calimport
	- sal gets high too, and can taste the magic
- sal, crel and one of skrappy's automatons are riding in craft boat, kay, audre and annith are in the original boat with crossbows and spells

# wait, are we the bad guys?
- sal is good at murder.
- mer-dur.
- he killed both a male and female siren, and found what looks to be eggs
	- oh god they're eggs
	- at least they're just eggs, and not little babbies
- we also found their house...oh good it's just full of corpses and not little merbabies
- there's lots of discussion on what to do with mermaid eggs
	- do we keep them?  morbidly?
	- do we kill them?  humanely?
	- do we give them to the town?  cowardly?
	- all of the above?  there are 7 eggs
- one of them hatched, and we don't know where the baby is.
	- nothing we can do about it now.
	- zippity-zap the rest of the eggs and take some trophies from the merpeople
	- skrappy gets the oars from craft boat and scoots off into the night
