# pretentious dicks and their rocks
* theoretically, our party doesn't actually know who big k is (kreshenn)
* however, we teleport to yartar anyway, to see a gnome about his rocks
* IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVING, we are accosted by guards and an angry gnome
	* just like last time -\_-
	* bachdeaux rockglow
* He runs the alchademy, an academy for alchemy
* he found some kind of divine rock, but they're in a dangerous place 
	* swampy area, maybe caving.  the rocks are stalactites (whichever ones are on the ceiling)
	* guarded by tolls?  mostly predictable apparently
	* they have some kind of yellowish glow
* hey has a kobold helper (pet??) named uggo.
	* he abuses her constantly
* this bachdeaux guy is a bad dude.
* will pay us 600g

# the path of big k
* after dealing with this, we decide to meet up with big k (kreshenn)
* he's out in the woods (because he's banned from yartar) with a kobold named zako
* zako is part of the Kobal, a cabal for kobolds
	* furthering kobold advancement and liberation
	* maybe terrorists
* they offer us more money to bring the rock to them, then back to rock-idiot
* they tell us that they don't mean to harm him, but we rolled low insight so who knows
* kreshenn offers us 200gp to do more, but we convince him to give us 400gp, with 200 up front.  he's not too happy with us
* however, he's in a bind apparently, and it has something to do with the kobal.  they must be more dangerous than we think
* audre is not okay with this situation, mostly because the swamps are full of water and she's afraid of water since [[ep24 - craft brew, meet craft boat]]
* she's also afraid that sam flam will come after her after [[ep33 - more like sham flam]] .  if he wants to find her, he'll find her apparently
	* annith points out that since audre has never been to yartar, there's nobody to rat her out to sam flam.
	* crelypsis hands her her cloak of elvenkind

# WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP/grease is the word
* after stocking up on *tons* of oil and alchemist fire, we head into the swamp
* we found a bunch of rocks, turns out they're a troll.
* but the cave is nearby so we dip into there
* the cave is nearly flooded, it's a struggle to get down there
* eventually, we find a chamber with the yellowish rocks in it.
* salphonse breaks some off
	* they're very heavy, but very brittle
	* sal tastes all kinds of magic in them
	* annith identifies the rocks and finds that they're radiating pure radiant energy
	* they're *very, very powerful.  tons of stored energy*
	* basically magic uranium
* annith convinces sal to break more off as the cave starts to flood
* sal uses shape water to help us escape, and basically saves our lives
* we escape the cave into a thunderstorm in the swamp, and we trudge our way back.
	* it's harrowing
* we decide to only leave as little as possible with the alcademy, these rocks are insanely powerful and rare, they have to be worth a lot.
* plus they could power a new robot

# dealz
* annith and crelypsis head back to town to get audre
	* audre is really happy that annith came back for her, and did it before finishing the job
* kay and sal go back to kreshenn and zako to bring them only a fist sized powerstone
* uggo does the thing to it.  it's perpetually warm now and she says to not handle it

# after 5 years, kreshenn gets his vengeance
* we bring the rock to rockglow.  We tell him that it's probably unstable, but he doesn't care, and shoos us away
* we run into zako as soon as we leave, and he takes us away from town
* he congratulates us, and leaves.  
* while trying to figure out a way home, kreshenn points out that he has a scroll of teleportation, and will sell it for 400gp
* sal actually buys it from him, but we intend to take a barge from yartar to waterdeep anyway for the adventure
* kreshenn walks away, looking *way* too smug about what we've done
* minutes after we bought the scroll, a brilliant white flash illuminates the sky, and yartar is basically vaporized
