purple people eaters
# the oasis
* found Tayibbe dead on the sand
	* bite on her is not dragon-sized
* found [[dipika]] with her
* traced to an oasis
	* very stinky
	* something to do with trolls or hags
	* definitely a hag.  yelling about something disgusting
	* very dirty, starts wounded
* in a cave under the oasis, we found that merchant we were looking for [[mahir]]
	* missing an arm
	* other hags in the tunnel died from some kind of slashing wound
	* Tayibbe must have died from the hags after slashing a bunch of them
	* went back for his sword

# back at camp
* Crelypsis brought back Tayibbe
* Annith and Salphonse went investigating for dipika 

# next day in the caravan
* there's a creepy rock on the side of the road
* it looks a lot like bone
* purple worms!
