# Return to Bryn Shander
- returned to speak to Shane
	- Didn't mention Azaelia from [[ep17 - do medusas multitask with snakes#sneaking into the basement of the speaker's house]].  We didn't want to attact attention to a medusa in the basement
	- Shane agrees to deal with the orcs by supplying a militia force?
	- We agree to "fix magical things"
		- we do need to find an expert that can close the portal that let the woerm through
			- Kreshenn????
			- or travel to another major city to find a reputable mage
		- also need to find a scroll of restoration for Azaelia
	- As we leave, she warns us that Lonelywood "has frequented by the worst of the worst".  Historically collected some nefarious types.
- prep for a trip to Lonelywood
	- [[annith]] really wants to buy lumber to make an extendable bridge
- in Lonelywood, [[kay lieri]] find two lumberjacks talking about the neighbouring woods having bad juju
	- birds don't sing, sun doesn't shine, etc etc
	- one of them claims to have seen a "fluffy white horse" but not like a sheep
	- much faster than one, pretty sure it flies
	- they're definitely haunted
- Annith gets raked over the coals trying to buy an axe from lumberjacks in the tavern
	- "can't just ask to buy a man's tool, it's an extension of the self"
	- a lumber...jane(???) offers to sell hers for 8gp, which is ridiculous

# lonelywood, lonely hearts
* trip through the forest goes mostly okay except [[crelypsis]] sees something in the woods
* once we get into town, we start to hear shouting at the north end of town near the Lucky liar
	* It's a big dragonborn yelling at a bunch of people.  A three-keen (bug person) is trying to counsel a plant creature, a firbolg, and a puffy little unicorn-pomeranean thing
	* the dragonborn is telling the cricket man to unsummon the unicorn thing
	* apparently it's a delivery for the cricket?
	* (theory) the dragonborn owns the plant man who bought the unicorn???
* welp, Kay's intruding
	* the cricket's name is sir whistleton
	* sounds like they ordered a unicorn but received a monohorn
	* the dragonborn is Kreshenn
	* the monohorn's name is Cyclone, and it likes sweets
* the moss giant thing is supposedly the guardian of the forest, and his cowering is making a bad impression on whistleton who's supposed ot evaluate him or something?
	* despite the lumberjacks being scared of the forest, the moss giant is apparently too scared to uphold the contract.  the contract is the issue
* what if Cyclone becomes the forest guardian?  The lumberjacks are already terrified of him
	* Whistleton is down but we have to figure out if this violates Kreshenn's contract
* what Kreshenn did
	* split off from the zhentybois
	* split off from the stom king's crew 
	* ran his own crew, basically a get rich quick scheme
	* made some enemies.  not welcome in waterdeep anymore
	* came into possession of some kind of information, the job is extremely lucrative
	* needs a unicorn as leverage for the job???
	* left the unicorn contract until the last minute and received a monohorn as he doesn't really understand sylvan and misread a fae contract

# joint custody
* the idea is to have cyclone and the moss giant share guardianship of the forest
* whistleton confers with his superiors to go over this deal, returns with a huge bundle of sticks and hands them to Kreshenn, says "a deal's a deal"
* Kreshenn owes us a favour
	* he'll be staying in lonelywood for a while, like a year, while things in waterdeep blow over

# next
* need to come up with what our home base will be
* figure out what the orcs are doing up north, why they're all explodey
