# still stuck, literally
- sal's hand is stuck in some kind of trap, the doors are shut
- and now there's ***deadly neurotoxin***
	- and ***bugs***
- annith passes out

# yes, this always happens to raman
- eventually the trap his arm is in starts to hum, reaching an apex, and blenderizes his arm
- the trap itself seems to drink the blood

# oh hey, storm king's thunder dream sequence
- as everyone passes out or gets blenderized, a hypnotic pattern appears on the floor
- we're all not-relly astrally projected (consious projection) into some shared dream thing
- the ground feels like it's moving under us
- we're on top of some kind of war-torn and devastated area
	- we're way above it in some kind of howling moving castle
	- ![[Pasted image 20221027190211.png]]

# oh no, it's much worse than that
- exploring this...thing...we find a pile of corpses (oh of course it's a pile of corpses)
-  we find some kind of denizen of the area, and he's just a mess
	- like a zombie but alive??
- he's got some kind of keyring, and crelypsis manages to actually get it off him by...reasoning?
- all kinds of abominations are walking around here
	- like some kind of fleshknit thing
	- real junji ito x hellraiser vibes
- annith finds a locked door
	- what a coinkydink that the entity that crel tamed has the necessary key
- inside is a huge creature made of hands, and a man with a corpse on a table
	- the hand creature propmtly tore crelypsis apart limb from limb
	- the man at the table was warning that "they" were coming
- everyone gets in to stabilize crelypsis and annith interrogates the man to no success
- eventually "they" turns out to be an armed squad of heavily armored dark-ish elves that shoot the whole room up
	- everyone ducks except for annith, who takes one out before getting gunned down
- back in reality everyone wakes up with all their limbs intact...except sal
- fight their way out of the trap room, for their reward:
	- a ring that when warn, lets the user open any of the other doors in the crypt.
	- find a cloak of elvenkind and a robe of stars (!!!)
- descend through the rest of the crypt, finding strange monoliths that pulse with evil red energy
	- seemingly powering the doors, and whatever else mechanical is going on in here, which you can hear behind the walls
- eventually reach the *actual* crypt: a black coffin that's being drip-fed blood from somewhere upstairs
	- probably salphonse's blood from when his arm was blenderized
- the coffin stirs, and whatever is inside awakens
- some kind of very tall woman covered in piercings, named Azul (check this)
- she thanks us for awakening her, and gives us whatever we wish for in that moment
	- Sal takes the offered scroll, which becomes a scroll of greater restoration
	- we can now save Hoggers!  
- Eventually make our way back towards the keep, and settle on the final design
