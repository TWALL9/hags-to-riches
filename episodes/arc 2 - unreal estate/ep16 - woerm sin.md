# off the string
- the woerm slinked off as soon as we saw it
- as we creep up the stairs, the thing slithers through a door and body slams [[audre]], carrying her off
- the lights that come on as we walk through the house get brighter if the woerm is near us, flickering as it approaches
- it grabs people with its spindly hairy arms, knocks them on the floor, then scoots away into the shadows
- someone is talking [[kay lieri]] in her head, calling himself 'the maitre.'
	- he says that we need to trick it to coming to the stones?
	- we need to trick it somehow, best option is trapping it. 
	- It's a creature from the shadowfell, so we need to find something that can link it there
- while investigating, crel finds a portrait of a woman that we think is the old Speaker (Speaker Knope) of dougan's hole
- we also find a library, filled with Nerd Shit
	- of which we are somewhat excited
- More exploring finds us a notebook belonging to Agnar Knope
	- something about the Thuun cursing the place
	- Agnar did some kind of ritual, but "the woermsin never crystalied"
- salphonse found a dollhouse or something
	- full of figures that look like us, and the woermsin
	- the woermsin figurine is covered in crystals, and it manifests in a different room later
- the bedroom
	- the bed has two dolls on it, with two portraits.  a man, and a child
	- the chest: full of clothes, with one much less worn cloak
- we've found a room adjacent to the master bedroom with a glowing green orb
	- the guy who was talking in Kay's head says that we need to lure it in there, where he can finish it
- the thing took crelypsis from the green orb room, and took her down to the main floor.  
	- she's in the dang fight of her life with it
- killing it makes it split in two.  We kill the other one and yeet both dead bodies into the green orb
- the maitre requests that one of us enter the orb to meet him, since he can't come to our plane

# salphonse raw-dogs the shadowfell
- without any protection or plan, salphonse enters the orb to meet [[maitre de bors]]
- he couldn't get back to the shadowfell without destroying the woerm
- so he needed to wait until one of them died, and for one of us to step through to free him
- "where are you headed now?"
	- "the raven queen calls, and i am finally able to answer"
- we're free to take his stuff
	- he's got some fancy knives
	
# pulling out
- there was a cloak next to the orb
	- annith left it behind, crel took it
	- there's a knife in the cloak that looks like the one that sal picked out
- there's a mask in the cloak
	- looks like maitre's
- the cloak that annith found in the chest is a [[Cloak of Protection]]
	- kay has it now
