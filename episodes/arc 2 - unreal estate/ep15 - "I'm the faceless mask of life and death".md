# the speaker's house
- the vibe in Dougan's Hole is bad.  I feel like I'm being watched while not seeing anyone else in the village

- send in Kay's snow ferret familar, and craft brew, torches glow, but not light
- annith detects a *lot* of conjuration magic.
- the party enters, and at the top of the stairs, they see it.
