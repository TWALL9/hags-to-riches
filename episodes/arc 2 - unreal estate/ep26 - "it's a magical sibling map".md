# funky bulakvir map
- translated by the dwarves??
- "By divine right, our duties fulfilled. We are catalyst, which hasten order from chaos. Seek our treasures, that we may live on."

# the dwarven proposal
- get the official draft of the guild hall blueprints
- it's a big hexagon, with an EVEN BIGGER hexagon for a wall

# floaty boat
- we've been asked to create a float for some kind of festival in easthaven
- shameless self-promotion

# SIMOOOONNNN
- we decide to take on the funky bulakvir map
- this involves figuring out where the doors to an ancient crypt are located: roughly on the side of a mountain
- this will take a couple days of searching
- eventually we find it

# why does this always happen to Raman
- we enter the strange crypt, and there are 3 doors
- only one opens for us
- inside are three chests
- annith finds that hte chests are held shut by magnets
- salphonse gets his hand stuck in a hole, and it snaps downward very quickly
	- is he going to lose a hand???
- hte doors slam shut
