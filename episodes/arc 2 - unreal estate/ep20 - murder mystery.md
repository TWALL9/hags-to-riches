# Kay is the speaker of caer koenig now
- and as such she needs to meet all the other speakers.
- the head speaker of tentowns is [[bryn shambles]] 's own Duvesa Shane (spelling?)
- for our guild to be licensed, we need a mailbox and the ability to open membership
- We've received **two letters**
	- The first one from [[heryd Rielsbarrow]] asking us to figure out who's breaking into alehouses
	- and another one, completely nonsensical symbols and other psychotic weirdness.  we can't make anything out of it.  either someone doesn't know how to write or was very disturbed

# meet the mead (house)
* heading to goodmeade to help out with the alehouse thing
* nobody's seen the perpetrator, but they always leave coins behind
* the smaller ones were broken into, and some private residences
* goodmeade has communal breweries, which is pretty cool
* no broken doors, no smashed windows.  
	* the only way people knew was that vats and carboys were emptied
	* and coins were left behind
* the biggest brewery wasn't broken into
* heryd tells us to speak to brudd
* crelypsis listens to the crowd in the ale house
	* pretty much any coins not in a pocket go missing.  anything not bolted to the ground
	* creatures looking for shinies?
* scuttlebutt at the tavern is that there is a former thief drinking his days away there
	* his name is daiso
	* annith gets in to investigate
	* gets groped
	* concludes that this guy has no idea what's going on and couldn't be the suspect
* while tihs is going on, a couple monks appear in the tavern
	* [[crelypsis]] recognizes them as Saheed and Yukio from [[ep09 - Yann and Yuan#Crelypsis' good deeds]] when they beat the crap out of her in the street
	* last seen with [[Washma Haja]] in her temple
	* turns out yukio is beginning her drunk boxing journey?
	* no street fights this time
	* kay suspects him of doing something shady
* meet Brudd at his house.  
	* The following excellent dialogue takes place
		* kay: "we're the uhh, lizard wizards"
		* sal: "yes, I'm a lizard wizard"
		* annith: "I'm not"
		* crelypsis: "taste the magic"
		* kay: "is this your mead hole"
	* not just coins, but FEATHERS were left behind
		* two coppers, a silver, and a black feather
		* likely a corvid feather
* we leave coins in various places overnight
	* a copper in the hallway, not taken 
	* a silver under crelypsis' pillow: not taken
	* a silver on the bedside table in crelypsis and kay's room with an open window: taken
* side note: the inn we stayed at was called ***good to mead you***

# kevin mcallister up in this shit
* artificers are really sleeping on the potential for prank-tier magic:
	* snare, alarm and grease as spell options
	* magical tinkering can create an object that emits a recorded message when touched
	* craft brew just looks like a barrel, good guard boy
* we check with the other mead hall owners that have been broken into
	* learn that the ones that were broken into are the ones that were close to finishing a batch
* we went back to the mead hall to find which brewery we should stake out
	* dofia
		* didn't actually start a batch this season
	* ovid
		* his were close to done and stolen
	* floris
		* has a batch nearing completion, this is the spot

# the plan
* open fermentation pot in a shed. shed has a window
* annith:
	* snare on a stool next to the pot
	* craft brew disguised as a barrel in the corner
	* alarm cast on the window.  mental alarm if anyone not from the party enters through the window
	* enchanted pebble that when touched says "are you done yet or are you thirsty for more" in the doorway
* sal
	* disguise self as a scarecrow for four hours, then just disguised
* kay
	* leaves a coin on the windowsill, for locate object
* crelypsis
	* hiding on a rooftop
* several crows land on the windowsill
	* the first crow takes the coin, leaves
	* the second one gets scared of sal, he's a scarecrow, duh
* sal turns off the disguise, then hides
* many more crows fly through the windowsill, 
	* they do not trigger snare as they don't weigh enough :|
	* looks like they are playing in the vat....get drunk, leave shinies
	* one is drunk, touches the pebble, absolute chaos as the message plays
	* 15-20 intoxicated birds flee out of the shed
* it's uncommon behaviour...but it can be learned.  Is someone training them?

# *problem solved*
