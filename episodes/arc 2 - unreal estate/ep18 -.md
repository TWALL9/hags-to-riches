# greasers vs greasiers
- we start at the encampment outside of Bremen
- looks like a brawl is going down.  Humans vs orcs
	- there's a giant buff orc woman.  she's using her nails as weapons
- there are orcs that are *super greasy* and are covered in puss-filled sacs or something
- they're running at the town.  one explodes when it trips.
- we manage to get to the town ahead of the oncoming wave of greaseballs, and now we have to fight them 
- ...manage to fight them.  The autocrossbow is extremely hit or miss
- meet the leader of Bremen, a dwarf named Bogden
	- bremen has been under seige for a tenday
	- the barbarians we saw earlier were Uthgart
- they have been able to fend off the orcs so far, but they need a speaker, and help.
	- targos has help
	- speaker shane can also help
	- the orcs are coming from the north but they don't know how far
	- the uthgart might know, but you have to deal with them

# the stones
* all of the inns in bremen have had their signs covered with rocks.  bogden calls them "the stones" since he previously owned one called "the stone"
* he doesn't own the other ones, but they've been deserted

# meeting the locals
- two uthgart babarans showed up in the tavern, one doesn't wear shirts
- they're standoffish, and won't explain why or how there are so many orcs or why they explode.
	- actually turns out to be because of their god's blessing or something
- They're defending bremen outside the town, but they're "fighting honorobaly" which means they're dying.
- they also don't trust magic, which isn't good for a party full of nerds.
- we decided to go back to targos for reinforcements, then to bryn shander as well, and arrive with the bryn shander reinforcements.
