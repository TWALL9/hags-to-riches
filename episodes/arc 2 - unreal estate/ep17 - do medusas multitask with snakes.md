# you meet yann in a tavern
- left dougan's hole to return to Good Mead to meet back up with Yann
- we don't know how to close the portal from the speaker's house, so we're going to have to investigate more stuff about how to think with portals

# heading to caer konig
* one of the larger towns in ten towns
* the entire western half is deserted
* there are ruined tracks to the speaker's house
	* [[kay lieri]] finds some scars on the stone floor
	* something was dragged here...up to a statue of a human in a hostile stance
	* clearly something was turned to stone

# sneaking into the basement of the speaker's house
- we encounter a voice in the basement, they're hiding
- someone that sounds very unconfident, wants us to find a scroll of restoration to "help their friend"
	- must be the person who turned to stone
- it's a medusa!
- her name is Azaelia, is more welcoming than you'd expect for a stonegazing monster
- she's been living in the basement of the caer with a pet hedgehog (hoggers) and she will pay us to find a scroll or anything that can help her fix her friend that she turned to stone by accident.
	- hoggers was turned to stone by accident
- her powers have to be activated by her, she won't turn everything to stone just by looking at it
- she was cursed by a "meanie" and then thrown through a portal to where she is now
- we're going to stay here with her as it's probably the safest place as long as she trusts us
- she makes really good tea

- we plan on making out way to bremen through bryn shander

# bremen
- as we approach, we hear the sound of distant war drums
- an emcampment on the outskirts of the town
	- lots of people here
	-
