# ugly amorphous sunuvabitch
- after dealing with crannoc, we  head downstairs to find Kip.  
- He's raiding a pantry...
- turns out it's full of mimics.
- this could explain the disappearances of house staff and servants, but not the messages we've been seeing scrawled on the walls in [[ep21 - Ib revenge arc confirmed#caer dinneval]]
- while fighting, spark marmaduke is almost gobbled up by a mimic.
	- didn't accept annith's offer of help by saying "please"
	- craft brew "helped" by bonking him on the head repeatedly
- annith also had to give kip mouth-to-[[bendy straw of reinvigoration]]
- using faerie fire to illuminate the mimics results in vines rearranging themselves to say BRILLIANT

# there are some that call me...trevor
* the tree in the middle of the courtyard moves in ways a tree shouldn't.
* crelypsis eats the fruit off the tree, at the trees suggestion
	* this allows trevor and crelypsis to communicate through her mind
	* apparently his friuts allow him to communicate with any nearby plant
	* there are bones of some kind around his roots???
	* apparently he was a sorcerer at one point, but is now a tree
* the bones are in the chapel, need to find a symbol or talisman of Joachim
	* saying a prayer at the bas relief causes an opening to form, stairs descending down to a landing
	* make our way down to the landing, vines on the walls on the way down reconfigure into a tapestry of some kind
* there is a flask on the landing.  A dark roundbottom flask filled with liquid darkness
	* a single glowing eye floats around in it
* find a [[wand of detect magic]]
* hat that can cast any cantrip but with a huge risk of backfire
