# dibika
- goddamnit, annith's two favourite people are in cahoots
- get back to the keep, and [[dipika]] is hanging out with ib
- we all get trinkets
	- annith gets a wrist sundial

# kay is into politics
- the monthly summons has arrived, and kay is ~demanded~ 
- so her, crelypsis and dipika go to bryn shambles
- it's time for annith to ***TEND TO THE PLANTS***
	- specifically crelypsis' herbs and poisons
- dipika reveals to kay and crelypsis that she's actually a polymorphed dragon, tells them to keep it hush hush
- apparently the Toy Soldiers are thinking of setting up shop in 10towns

# and you will know us by the trail of petty insults
- and annith/audre get a petty letter from [[sam flam]] 
	- he's petty and shitty about losing...something.  called annith a dumbass and asked what audre sees in him
	- did he and [[audre]] do the fuck?
	- there will be a NEW ROBOT

# stardew dwarvalley
- a bunch of dwarves show up, speaking dwarven
- annith is the only one that knows dwarven
	- maybe they're racist
- ib summoned them, without our knowing, with a "work order"
	- *WHAT DID HE PAY THEM WITH*
	- the actual work order he sent them looks a lot like his resume
- his name is hirudar burrowfist
- ib is now boss, due to how the work order has been drawn up.
	- this is a bad development
	- he regards annith as a "wrench"
	- he also asked for two proposals based on what the dwarves are surveying
- apparently ib paid in full **for the assessment** before the dwarves arrived
	- in gold.
	- where did the money come from???
	- we don't even pay him!
	- apparently he found enough loose change in the abandoned houses to afford it
-  later, the dwarves roll in with a couple of kegs
	- heck yeah
- the dwarves met azaelia
	- we made the executive decision to help her meet people, but not without warning them first
- the dwarves also agree to fix annith's anvil, for a small fee
- the caer will cost 25k gold to fix
