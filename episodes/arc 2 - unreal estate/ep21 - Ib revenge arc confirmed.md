# it's gobbin' time
- wake up in the morning, feeling like g-diddy
- there's a gobbo making us breakfast in the inn.  what the hell is going on
- he's making ankheg stew, asking if we run the guild
- his name is Ib
	- NONONONONONONONONONO
- he stole the ingredients
- apparently he was sent here from waterdeep.  the absolute nonsense letter from [[ep20 - murder mystery]] was his cover letter
	- ![[ibs-cover-letter.png]]
	- he's waiting for Big Spoon
- oh god we hired him
	- Annith was the one dissenting voice
- he's waiting for his "little birdie" to tell him where his ladle is
	- not a literal little birdie, he's basically waiting for a sign where his ladle is
	- his ladle is different from his ***S P O O N***
	- HE HAS THE ***S P O O N*** 

# you've got mail again
- we've received a package
	- 100 gp and a letter
- letter is to investigate a ghostly presence in Caer Dinneval
	- from crannoc siever
	- the speaker still lives there, but has noticed that some townsfolk have gone missing
	- duvessa (speaker for lonelywood) says that crannoc is a blowhard that hasn't left his caer in months
	- the contract is to prove the caer isn't haunted
- we've decided to leave Ib with Bulakvyre and Azalea

# caer dinneval
* small town with two docks.
* fishing is a big deal here, but the great soupening put a stop to that
* meet with some kind of zap brannigan esque guy who's trying to oust the speaker because the speaker hasn't left the caer in months
	* "clearly, it's haunted.  it's on everyone's lips"
* spark (the zap guy) is being sexist and only talking to sal
	* crel, kay and annith decide "fuck this guy, we're proving this place isn't haunted"
* spark wants to prove the place is haunted, for his own gain, crannoc wants to prove it's not, because he lives there
* annith and crel aren't very successful at getting stories from the locals, but annith is successful in getting the gate to the caer opened by physics and a lever
* after we reach the second floor of the keep, we find crannoc bleeding out in his bed
	* he's injured, something attacked him and he barricaded himself in his bedroom
	*
