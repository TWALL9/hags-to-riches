# you bet it's time for robot rumble
* lots of people have shown up to bryn shambles to watch the event
- annith & audre's team: The Craft Bruisers
- our entry: a 4-legged super-craft-brew (called "Stout")
	- because he's thick
	- ![[Pasted image 20230226201338.png]]
	- a body like this: except with a harpoon gun and a single big mace arm
- re-meet some teams (the Sky High???) that we saw in calimshan during [[ep10 - all in all it's another hole in the wall]]
	- spacer (female elf), malcolm (aaracockra male), lady wincroft (female elf)
	- love how sam flam was thrown in jail
- [[transmuter henry]] has been hired to set up some safety magic in the arena
	- still very into kay, wants to show her something in private
		- see [[ep11 - you seem like the experimental type]]
	- has some way to fuse spells
		- add a cantrip effect to a spell you know (that isn't damage)
		- like chromatic sphere's element damage being random, but add it to magic missile
	- can also find a way to reduce a spell casting time to a bonus action, but without damage
- also kaye and sal explain the whole map thing that lead to [[ep28 - ancient tomb of ambiguous purpose]] and how sal lost a hand

# meanwhile...
* crelypsis is in the stands with everyone, and thinks she sees something
* salphonse also smells some magic
	* transmutation mostly, but that could be explained by henry
* as the round opens, a hooded figure grabs crelypsis and disappears
	* sal sees this and immediately tastes conjuration
	* misty step?
* crelypsis is falling through a void, but then she stops
	* sees Shahid (her mentor in calimshan??)
	* he says this is her trial to overcome, and apologizes that she doesn't have more warning
* she is returned, but in a halfway-present dimension.  people seem hollow, as if they're not there

	* a hammerhead man.  hammerman
	* JESUS CHRIST HIS NAME IS SWIM SHADY

# meanwhile...the real swim shady has stood up
* and he and crelypsis are struggling

* shark guy has the advantage ofc
* but crel pulls out a HUMONGOUS hellish rebuke and frees herself
# turn 3
* stout lands a massive stomp on wood guy
* wood guy reaches up and grabs stout's mace arm
# meanwhile...
