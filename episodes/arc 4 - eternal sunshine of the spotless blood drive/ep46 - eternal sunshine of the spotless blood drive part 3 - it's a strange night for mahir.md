# the calimshan goodbye
- audre was bumped by someone or something that her and annith couldn't see, and asked if she was wearing a wrist bangle before, because now it's lost
- audre and Mahir are leaving, back to calimshan
- mahir to finish up some business
	- also he and crelypsis kiss and it's super adorable
- audre is homesick and probably depressed
	- annith is going to send craft brew with her to keep her safe
# these ladies love the magic salamander
- sal is in the north wing 
- talking about getting her up to tentowns since we have the speaker for caer koenig with us (kaye)
# lessons in egoism
- dragonborn man giving the lecture

# note to self
- when audre leaves, make a bangle that looks exactly like the one she lost
