# previous session stuff that should be in git
- ran into adil again on the boat
	- he can teleport and is more than what he says he is
	- has a job for sal
	- also was there with the spirit of the half orc who's head was in the junk we pulled out of our propeller
		- his name is Torq
		- and where annith got her sword
	- adil's task is for sal to do a "scavenger hunt"
		- find nesh
		- tell her that "bonbon did it"
		- follow the clues to find torq's greatest treasure
- Callie also showed up on the boat, she was looking for a charm that was on the scabbard of the orc's old sword
- annith and audre are given the manual for the power systems of the boat
	- they're written in draconic, and are very complicated
	- they're also apparently very powerful and the legacy of Will, the captain/designer of the boat
- sal was also offered to visit the spice wizard's tower (his name is Herb)
# sal gets laid
- Coz really wants to bang him
- turns out that sal is a special type of lizardfolk called a "chosen" that has higher intelligence than others
- Coz is really into that
- sal is not
- he brings up that he was raised by elves so he has no idea how lizard sex works
- turns out that there are hermaphrodites or something?

# luskan
# kay breaks up a domestic
- we're supposed to bring a message from Torq's ghost to a woman named Nesh
- getting up to nesh's house, we hear a raging domestic going on with some half-orc slurs are being thrown around
- Kay decides to break up the domestic, Nesh opens the door "the fuck you want"
	- "torq's dead"
	- "that fucking idiot"
- Tell her that "bonbon did it"
- nesh really doesn't want to do the thing, until we point out that there may be money involved
- nesh is torq's daughter
- CLUE 1: "I loved the sea, but she didn't love me"
	- nesh knows what the deal is, starts walking us to another part of the town
	- to her mom's house, not a happy reunion. he has a box with a ribbon that torq saved for her in the event of his death
- CLUE 2: there is a medallion in the box
	- some kind of mercantile thing
	- inscribed with dwarven runes: dates and the word "mirabar"
	- "They come in all sizes, and can be dried, cleared, or cut. I know that you've been in a rut.  P.S. If you are forced to a stop, show this to the fop."
	- the answer is **the throat** a location in luskan's northern edge
	- the coin gains us access to the dwarven enclave in the throat, apparently torq was a client of the banks there
		- but seemed a good sort
- CLUE 3: Isolated. Sanguine. Dead. You will face many challenges ahead.
	- blood island, duh
- CLUE 4: I know you're mad, but please cheer up and be happy. 'bout time you met your old grandpappy. Now this part can be dangerous, but do your best, due west, and keep an eye out for the family crest.
	* nesh knows instinctively where this is, and takes us to a hidden trap door
	* There is a stash of stuff fit for an orc chieftain in here, including some kind of magic hammer, which annith gives to nesh as it's likely a family heirloom
	* nesh bashes open a door with it, revealing the ghost of grandpappy, who goes into a barbarian rage at seeing his hammer not where it should be
	* we give him a big bonk and he comes to...
* CLUE 5: Grandpappy gives the players a 3-masted ship in a bottle, 2 sailor's hammocks, and insists on selling the party a length of Canvas.
	* the ship in the bottle is unadorned, but the sails are the same material as the canvas and 2 hammocks
	* also we were given a single copper coin
	* we're stumped
* we decide to go to an old favourite tavern of nesh's. she orders us desserts, which are icy...and creamy
* we're served another platter, which is actually 2 platters stacked on top of one another
	* there are 3 pages between the two, evidence points towards the host tower of the arcane
* CLUE 6: "towering, mysterious", "arc, cane and secrets", "hostess of the ball"
	* nesh does some kind of secret knock on a rock on the ground near it, and another clue pops out
* CLUE 7: "Don't close yourself off. Shore up and keep an even keel. 30 paces north and my treasure is yours to steal."
	* the open shore
	* there is an old, dilapitated rowboat, beached and rotting, 30 paces north, and there is a buried chest
	* inside there are two items: a letter, and the other half of the charm that was given to callie quickstep
	* nesh now has both pieces, so callie must have brought the piece here to put in the box
* annith gives nesh her dad's +2 scimitar
# arcane appointments
- sal has a date with herb, to discuss culinary mancy at the hosstower of the arcane
- there is a receptionist, named Eddy. She recognizes Audre through the construct battles and also recognizes Annith as her favourite rookie!
	- eddy looks like some kind of water elemental had a baby with an elf?
-  Herb comes down and starts to give us the tour, before we're cornered by Minerva, who looks like the kind of instagram indie witch type with long hair, bangs, and round sungalsses. she wants to know if we're here for the blood drive. herb begins to sweat.
