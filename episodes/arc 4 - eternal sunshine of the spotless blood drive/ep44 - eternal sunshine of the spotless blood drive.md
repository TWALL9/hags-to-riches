# It's not hogwarts...but it's hogwarts
- north wing - divination
- south wing - evocation, devilology, "southern history"
	- something to do with artimancy 
- east wing - "witchy"
	- crystals, goth-ness, and mood lighting, enchantment
	- run by isobel
- west wing - "spice"???
	- no, it's geopolitics, geology, archaeology, transmutatoin
	- the old white guy tower

# blood for the witch mommy, skulls for the...masturbatorium?

# he's not in control of the spice, therefore not in control of anything
- minerva has some dirt on herb and she's blackmailing him
- we're listed as his apprentices, and have limited access in the tower
- one of the apprentices knows "his secret"
	- he won't tell us what his secret is
- we're supposed to go to an "apprentice party" where this apprentice is
	- this apprentice is in contact with minerva
	- if we find this apprentice, we're to use a modified spell scroll on them that removes a single memory from their mind
* decision is made for kay, sal, and ib to do the west and north wings, and audre, annith, crelypsis and mahir to do the east and south wings
	* party time
* The decision becomes "what do we do when we figure out what the scandal is"
	* if herb needs to be brought to justice:
		* can extract the memory from him and tell the head of a neutral house (like north or south, since west has beef with east)
		* can extract the memory of herb telling us about the job and show it to head of neutral house
	* kay can just learn the spell on the scroll
	* if we decide to follow through with herb's request
		* he will give us more access to the hostower as official apprentices, or at least get us in for tuition
		* will give us usage of their teleportation gate, and a method to return to the hostower easily
# magic republican national convention (west wing party)
- quiet chamber music, second, third, and negative first hand smoke
- the west wing doesn't socialize with other wings
- pretty haughty, nobody cares about the other wings
	- herb at one point said that the east branch was more of a "well we have to accommodate the women" thing
	- noticeably high wizards (tim, octavius) think of herb associating with the east wing is like an insult. "he belongs over there"
	- anything less than the study of old magic is "east wing" stuff
# witch house (east wing party)
- literally a witch rave
- the mood lighting is indeed on point
* everyone is on psychadelics
	* from the punchbowl?
* so many critter familiars
