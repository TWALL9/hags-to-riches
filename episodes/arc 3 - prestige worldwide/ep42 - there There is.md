# the raft

# the orb
- is sentient
- contains a demiplane, an actually quite large demiplane.  large extra-dimensional space
	- more like barovia than a bag of holding
- literally a wish manifest that has become corrupted
	- if the wish is impossible to complete, it becomes a "wish orb"
	- in order for it to be used again, it must be purified
	- dunno how, but probably involves entering the extra-dimensional space

# the halfling (callie)
* "bon bon did it"
	* eyes narrow
	* there's half a medallion on the hilt of the sword, she takes it and we keep the sword
