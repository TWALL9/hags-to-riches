# returning home
- CAN'T TOO BAD IT'S FIREFLY SEASON ON THE COAST
	- this is apparently a very bad hting, and nobody is going north up the coast
- we do find a river boat crewed by kobolds and helmed by wilthanshtial veciluxiros (will)
	- gold dragonborn very small
	- I think he's an artificer, the boat has some kind of steel frame
- never mind they're headed up the coast it's firefly time baby
- we have met the spice wizard
	- passenger on this ship, literally describes himself as a spice wizard
	- maybe an alchemist?
- another person on the boat just clearly doesn't want to be there
	- maybe a highborn person?
	- introduces herself as Antala to Crelypsis
	- she's calishite
	- Audre is also calishite
	- she's here on "family business"
- audre misses home, she's talking to antala a lot
- over the course of several weeks, we've arrived off the coast of Neverwinter
	- the water gets brighter, and it's full of giant firefly squid
