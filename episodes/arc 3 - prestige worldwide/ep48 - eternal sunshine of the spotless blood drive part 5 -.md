- we figure that we'll wait till we know more about who's memory to erase if we're able to ask [[leonard]] and [[herb]] some more questions
- but we can also copy the scroll herb gave us because wizards
	- we're just going to copy the spell haha get rekt herb
# crelypsis goes unsnugged
- [[beth]] returns after crelypsis has a lonely, no-snugs-from-mahir night
	- "her special brew" which she was tempting the armless bois with last night, is literally a potion to restore their arms
	- [[salphonse]] doesn't go for it because he doesn't trust beth

# fast travel unlocked
- herb gives us a stamp on the wrist where if we utter the word we teleport back to the closet in the hosstower, so long as we're on the same plane
- the hosstower also has a permanent teleportation circle chamber, so we have access to a teleportation network too
	- hard-connected to specific other circles
	- don't need to cast the spell if we know where we're going

# we need to check the mail
- we port back to bryn shambles, and we've missed some things
- we've been gone for at least a month (since [[ep34 - big k's big day]])
- kaye's at least missed a bunch of administrative nonsense
- the lakes and rivers have more or less cleared up
- we now have squatters in caer konig
- DOUGAN'S HOLE GODDAMNIT [[ep16 - woerm sin]]
- lonelywood also has some nonsense, people are disappearing
	- where we met [[kreshenn]] and his homie
- something is going on in bremen, where we saw the orcs in [[ep18 - babarans]]
	- this is the newest issue
