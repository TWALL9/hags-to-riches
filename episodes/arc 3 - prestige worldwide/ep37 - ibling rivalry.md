# waterdeep
- if i want to find timonthy: field of triumphs in the sea ward
- as we arrive in the harbour...
	- a ton of alarms go off, elementals are summoned automatically by these magic alarms
	- something crashes into the water from the sky, creating a massive wall of water that threatens to crush the city
	- but it is protected by a shimmering sphere of force
	- there is also a merman...he's the one who summoned the wall of force
- at first guess, this skyship appears to be piloted by [[transmuter henry]]...but it's a gith ship
	- likely a githzerai ship (the monastic ones, not the crazy fascist ones)
- one of them is named Odyssea, and tells crelypsis through her mind to come to their ship tomorrow night
- we also find [[mahir]] and ib, who have arrived to meet us here
	- we left them way back when in caer konig, before we left for yartar
	- mahir also tells crelypsis that dipika has something for her
	- it's a book, a massive book

# generic nondescript inn in the sea ward
- where mahir and ib were staying
- there is a dog here.
	- this dog is playing poker and is wearing shades
	- literally the only detail jesse gave us
	- "this guy is wheeling and dealing"
- mahir explains the book: "the book of faces"
	- you can tear out a page and give it to someone,
	- the page will re-appear in the book, and anything written on one page will be displayed on the other
	- the first page has a picture with dipika's face, and instructions
- we also learn by overhearing other patrons that there's an illithid on the loose and that someone's brain has been sucked out
- we also learn that [[timonthy fuckin wall]] is around, with malcolm and agnol from [[ep32 - robot rap battle aka will the real swim shady please stand up]]
- we also learn that there are *two* libraries in waterdeep
- before we go on a library crawl because we're nerds, we leave ib with the dog, playing dice
	- ib will lose all his money

# library-crawl pt 2, electric boogaloo, temple of oghma
- library of nonfiction, anything here is The Truth
- bunch of destitute folks are here, giving their stories to the priests for admission to the library
	- must be how they gain all their knowledge
- crelypsis finds a book on herbalism (and the new crafting system)
	- wants to make tinctures and stuff
	- coast plants can be made into potions of greater healing, love potions and an oil that can give a temporary +1 to weapons
	- survival check to find the ingredients
	- another check to brew the potion
- kay is learning about "magic"
	- literally an entire giant section of candlekeep
	- she's going through spellbooks and learning new spells
- salphonse is looking for "unsolved mysteries"
	- really nestled away part of the library
	- he's following a familiar smell, that is familiar, and leading him to more mysteries
	- in a small room, is a figure, and he smells dank
	- it's [[adil]]
	- he's here to solve some mysteries, and wants sal to join him.  there's a secret that this temple is keeping, and he wants to know what it is.  he has no clue as to the nature of this secret
	- "i know it's in the basement, man"
- annith goes to the section on automatons and finds timonthy and agnol
	- they're working on a robot for an obstacle course
	- tell them about sam flam and his shenanigans
	- timonthy points out that sam didn't have the resources or skill to make someting like tinkertank [[ep33 - more like sham flam]]
	- he must have had help, even if he's only a one man team
	- get some books and info on the obstacle course
		- also timonthy's address and contact info

# back at the super generic inn
- on the way back, we find a group of kenku, busking
	- vocalizing the instrumentatoin
- ib manages to win a ton of money against the gambling dog, who apparently just has a gambling problem.

# "i'm somewhat of an investigator myself"
- whoever is the earliest to wake (kay) finds a family-friendly play poster in the tavern about a goblin facing down an illithid
- we're going to go see the play
- we learn more about the murders (the sea ward slasher, now confirmed to be an illithid)
	- the first few were stabbed or slashed, mundane murders
	- afterwards there were signs of brain extraction
- the play is mc'd by an actress named weiss
	- and acted by two more of ib's sisters, Fib and Glib
	- fib is the hero who slays the sea ward slasher
	- weiss plays the villain
- ib has "many" sisters
	- there was also squib from [[ep32 - robot rap battle aka will the real swim shady please stand up]]
	- the "iblings"
- weiss is also "somewhat of an investigator herself" and recruits kay to solve the mystery too
	- gives her a note with an address to check on the cadavers

# the necropolis is totally not a trap
- the address from weiss was in the city of the dead
- totally above board all is good here
- shady individual in the morgue (bartholomew theovold hume)
-
