# like a moth to flame
- there's a commotion in the west wing
- herb is on the floor, memory strands spilling out of his head
- [[octavius]] has held [[luna]] up to the wall with telekinesis, and [[tim]] has a fireball prepped to kill her
- apparently she decided to try and "untangle" herb's mind, taking the suggestion from annith a little too literally
- all of the crew is summoned to the room to explain themselves.
- sal points out that the only person who can probably fix herb is luna right now
- [[isobel]] materializes in the room
	- "again, luna?"
	- this implies that this is the second incident where luna has unspooled someone's brain
	- isobel defuses the situation, and teleports a bunch of us to some kind of demiplane?

# the black cat infirmary
- we're in some kind of inky blackness room thing
- [[minerva]]'s cat familiar is here

# reassembling herb's ramen block
- we are each given a different noodle of memory, and told to reassemble it to recreate what Herb is
- learned a few things
	- herb had a wife who died early
	- his best man became a revenant 
	- he boned an older version of his dead wife in the fluid donation closet
- the elder version of his wife is a shapeshifter, [[maeven]] is an incubus therefore a shapeshifter

# sherlock holmes of academic dishonesty
- So herb's not the bad guy
	- honestly a win-win with [[maeven]]. herb gets to bone down with his old wife and maeven gets some soul energy to eat
- if anything, [[minerva]] is the bad guy for figuring it out and blackmailing herb.

# this cannot go badly
- while this is going on, [[leonard]] is in another room in the infirmary stoned out of his gourd
- annith is telling him that there is a secret cabal of invisible people in the east wing that steal bangles
- also that her name is [[adil]] and that she's a powerful otherwordly entity
