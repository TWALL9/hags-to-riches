# like a moth to flame
- there's a commotion in the west wing
- herb is on the floor, memory strands spilling out of his head
- [[octavius]] has held [[luna]] up to the wall with telekinesis, and [[tim]] has a fireball prepped to kill her
- apparently she decided to try and "untangle" herb's mind, taking the suggestion from annith a little too literally
- all of the crew is summoned to the room to explain themselves.
- sal points out that the only person who can probably fix herb is luna right now
- [[isobel]] materializes in the room
	- "again, luna?"
	- this implies that this is the second incident where luna has unspooled someone's brain
	- isobel defuses the situation, and teleports a bunch of us to some kind of demiplane?

# the black cat infirmary
- we're in some kind of inky blackness room thing
- [[minerva]]'s cat familiar is here
