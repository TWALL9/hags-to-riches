- offers [[salphonse]] the ability to sell their stuff in the [[calimshan#Grand Ward]]

- Dorsalis is a tiefling captain/corsair
	- runs a tight ship but we just need to stay out of the way

	- apparently they're new here and just arrived
	- crew looks super sketch, willing to teach us to sail
	-

- Transmuter Henry the airship philosopher
	- he's the owner of the airship Kay saw before
	- "traveling the lands"
	- he's got a crew and is just kind of traveling around

# [[Annith]] and Tinker
- starts learning with the toy soldiers about how Tinker works
- her theory is that there's some kind of animating force making tinker act autonomously like it does
	- like a ghost or a spirit, [[audre]] is interested in that
- takes a few test rounds on the rifle with [[timonthy fuckin wall]] and [[sam flam]]
	- she's good at it, really good at it
- enter the konami code into tinker's controller and it blows a hole in a building

# Crelypsis' good deeds
- came up from the underground
- finds a beggar that looks vaguely familiar, gives him some coppers
- now he wants to fight her
	- they get in a scrap
	- Crelypsis uses her fire breath, he neo-dodges out of there
	- something like "only using 10 percent of my power"
- his name is shahid 
	- some kind of ethereal phantom arms ability -> HE'S GOT A FUCKIN STAND
	- he's from the Temple of Ascension, some kind of monastery?
	- he wants to teach Crel on how to see?
- finds yann/salphonse, off to find Annith

# Meet back up
- decided that we'll take the snakes up on their offer to sell scrimshaw in the grand ward as long as [[yann]] makes them a scrimshaw masterpiece
- we want to try and buy salphonse's sister's freedom
- crelypsis will help yann carve the scrimshaw

# meet with the snake people
- they're really into crelypsis
	- they think she's (and all tieflings) horns/tails are cute and slave/pet-worthy
- yann is going to stay with them while he's working

# next steps
- Freeing salphonse's sister
	- need to find dipika or the street paws to find her
- scrimshaw
	- move all the stuff into the grand ward so we can sell them
- crelypsis is going to the monastery and crypt ward
- kay wants to go back to the library
- annith wants to return to the makers' ward to get the power supply/animator
