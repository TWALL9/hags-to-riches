# oh yeah we take care of people here
- return to caer koenig to find bulakvyre, azaelia and hoggers have all been fine since we left.
- looking at the list of problems in [[ep48 - eternal sunshine of the spotless blood drive part 5 - the boys are back in town]], we decide to go back to dougan's hole [[ep16 - woerm sin]]

# it's immediately clear why we hate this place
- dougan's hole is still a run down shit heap
- except now there is literally nobody home.
	- there are people here, but they aren't people.
	- but they're also not zombies
- the people here simply stand motionless and stare out of windows or at walls. they do not react when spoken to, and we really don't want to mess with them.
- kay and annith decide to scope out the speaker's house while Sal and Crelypsis scope out the old 20 stones of Thruum
- kay and annith
	- the speaker's house is definitely no longer occupied by the original speaker. but it is occupied.
	- there are black and red banners hanging on either side of the door. OOC they look very "fascist-fashion"
	- the door is opened by an absolute mountain of a man. easily 8 feet tall and completely muscled.
	- has a hood over his head
	- named Skins
	- skins takes us to meet Sinphony, the master of the house
	- sinphony is not the speaker, but he helps the speaker
	- this guy is unbelievably creepy. and unbelievably powerful
	- drops some shadowfell references. this house also had a shadowfell portal on the top floor a while back, so maybe he came here through that?
	- the "speaker" of the house is still asleep, and Sinphony says to come back later.
	- he's a gracious host if anything, but he's still a creepy fuck
	- he smells annith on the way out.
	- at some point crelypsis meets annith and kay here, and her orb from [[ep42 - there There is]] starts vibrating like crazy
- crelypsis and sal
	- crelypsis punches a fish out of the water, and now annith owes her 100 gold
	- the pair explore the town some more before heading over to the stones of thruum
# well it's going to be in the last place you looked
- there's a mysterious air around the stones of thruum. noticed it last time. a feeling of doubt and ickyness
	* sal figures out that the shadowfell tastes like doubt. so this area may be a shadowfell portal in some way
* because of portal wonkyness, annith's [[misplacer cloak]] explodes, leaving all kinds of random junk on the ground. including Audre's missing bangle from [[ep45 - eternal sunshine of the spotless blood drive part 2 - one gallon of bodily fluids]]
* the wish orb also goes wonky, and expels a man from itself
	* the guy is *freaking out* and needs to be restrained by kay and annith
* eventually he comes to, but makes a break for it. 
	* he trips forward as kay grabs him, and they disappear
