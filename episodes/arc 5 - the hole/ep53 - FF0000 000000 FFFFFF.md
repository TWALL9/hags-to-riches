# riddles in the dark
- waiting in the fish house overnight to catch the person who threw the rock earlier
- a woman comes in the window in the middle of the night (NOT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING)
- Says she and her brother joined the cult 3 weeks ago
- they did some ritual, and now he's pregnant or something
	- nauseated
	- something moving around in his belly
	- very much like de'borde spoke about
- there are also body parts in the forest
	- used to make the flesh golems?
- the cult leadership (father creed) is away right now, but coming back to finish the ritual
- we give her a rockie talkie so she can contact us for help
- we are planning to go out to the forest to investigate the bodies, then bring the findings to cult leadership
	- another plan is to portal back to the hoss tower with the brother to see if any mages there can help him.
