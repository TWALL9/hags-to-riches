# y'all with the cult?
- we've decided to knock on the cult's door to see what they're all about
- couldn't get the password right (the riddle was "the fish swim south where it's warmer") so we just professed our innocence and were let right in
	- "we're just travelling academics"
- the cult is taking up residence in a generic place of worship
	- multiple idols of gods and goddesses here.
	- waukeen
	- goddess of travel
	- lathander
- this is a cult of the raven queen
- three acolytes in dark cloaks that obscure faces
	- sister allure: turns out she's actually a hottie redhead half elf
	- brother blind: only speaks in grumbles
	- sister somethingorother: very slight build, very small
		- could be a child?
- one other acolyte that is very silent in the corner of the temple
- learned that:
	- they've all been here less than 3 months (we were in dougan's hole 3 months ago)
	- they all came from different places under the orders of the raven queen
	- they don't mean anyone any *outward harm*
- they're planning some kind of ritual
	- they've been planning it for weeks
	- they say it's very exciting, and if we want in we should be an acolyte with them
- to become an acolyte, we need to talk to one of the elders/seniors: Elder Creed
	- who is not home right now

# kay may have a concussion, but we learned something interesting
- as we leave, kay is hit in the head with a rock, the rock has a scroll attached to it
	- thrown by a cultist who darted off. Annith couldn't catch them
- the note says that the cult has done something with the rock thrower's brother, and that there is something inside him now
	- maybe the person standing silently in the temple?
- note also says to meet the thrower in the fish house at sunrise
	- we're going to sleep there overnight
- decide that it's a good idea to see Maitre De'Borde about this, he does Raven Queen stuff
	- he says that he's aware of her rituals, but has no idea which of many horrible things are stuck in this man
	- says that most of the time these rituals are done in the shadowfell, with the fact that the ritual victim has better conduit to the entities being summoned.

# Fascionistas
- Once we leave the shadowfell, annith goes off to scrounge some materials for her New Brew
- sal, kay, bulakvir and crelypsis return to Hemmend's house, and she opens the door herself
	- inside are 5 mannequins dressed with outfits styled like her own, but each are unique
	- "Oh good, you're right on time for your fitting, hate to have to kill anyone who's late (annith)"
