# something something plato's cave
- kay awakens in the shadowfell
- like a huge set of stairs going down on one side and up in another, like a big V
	- the stairs are hundreds of feet wide
	- they're also at least a hundred feet tall
- there is a cave set in the wall of the stair she's on, and she sees the man run in there
- she chases him
# experiments in mental torture
- meanwhile, sal, crelypsis, bulakvyre and annith all have to figure out how to do whatever kay and the distraught man did so that they can get her back
- running, falling, other magic doesn't work
- eventually they figure out that if they want to do exactly what the crazy guy was doing, it's to touch the stone while crying
	- turns out bulakvyre is very good at making sal cry
	- a tear from sal's hand touches the stone and they're off
- crelypsis and annith do the same thinking about their long-distance boo's

# combat? in this campaign?
- we all arrive to see kay running into the cave, and follow her. 
- inside is a creature called a [TOTALLY LOST I DO NOT REMEMBER]
- this creature has the ability to make itself invisible to those that it hits
- however, it can't be invisible if it's on fire, and we discover this because we light it on fire
- it's hurt, and disappears
- we hear a voice coming from the rock wall
- it's maitre de bordes, from [[ep16 - woerm sin]] (even if it wasn't recorded)
	- he is a powerful shadowfell being, tasked with preventing powerful shadow creatures from crossing over into the material plane.
	- he offers us a bounty on the CREATURE WITH NO NAME
	- and basically an unlimited amount of time to do it. 
	- we decide to take him up on the offer...later
