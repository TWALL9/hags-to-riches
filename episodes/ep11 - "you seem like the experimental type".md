# Washma do some cool shit
- [[Washma Haja]]
- Somehow she knows [[crelypsis]]

	- it does not go well (literally 3 nat 1's in a row)
	- annith resolves herself to not fight monks ever again

# [[Transmuter Henry]] the airship philosopher
- [[ep09 - Yann and Yuan#Kay back on the docks]]
- He invited Kay over to do weird magical stuff earlier today
- his place is inexplicably luxurious, are the yuan-ti paying for this as well?
- clearly he meant for this to be a date with Kay.  
	- but we're here for *unparalleled awkwardness*
- he's afraid of the political impact of unlimited airships
	- like a *PUSSY*
	- Annith does not approve of this stance
- He has (had) a glowing rock from the underdark
	- it's gone dim
	- Annith tricks him by using artificer stuff on it to make it glow again
- he found some kind of different way to do magic
	- "schools are too dogmatic these days"
	- it's all in some kind of script in some hybrid Sylvan and Elven dialect
	- names are recognizable in the root form, like Jon/John/Jonathan
- There is also a map with a secret marked on an X
	- somewhere southeast of Icewind Dale

- starts rough but crelypsis figures it out

- how does she know dipika?
	- "such an adorable helper"
- apparenlty there's always a change of going to jail for construct battles
- annith literally cannot get the hint that audre may have a thing for her
	- ![[insight 1.png]] 
- later on, annith meets audre at the restaurant, 
	- doesn't see anything amiss
- *suddenly, annith finally gets it*
	- and has no idea how to react
	- like HOW ![[insight 2.png]]
- who's the scheduled opponent?  No idea.
	- Called "The Scarecrow"

# kay's scrimshaw selling shenanigans
