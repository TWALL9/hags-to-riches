# yartar is sinking and i don't wanna swim
* except it's literally burning and not sinking
* Annith still doesn't wanna swim to waterdeep
	* waterdeep is literally 200 miles away, whoops
	* holding onto the [[teleportation scroll]] just in case
* luckily, a large (almost comically too large for the river) boat has arrived, and offers us a ride as refugees
* invited aboard by [[boat crew#elovar (bosun)]] and [[boat crew#boy (cabin boy)]]
* in the below decks kaye and sal meet the navigator [[boat crew#hestram (navigator)]]
	* He's planning a trip to chult, which has to do with [[ep31 - the wicker man#path of the hogchamp]]
* eventually we meet the first mate, kip.
	* from [[ep22 - Only a woman could be so petty]]
* WHICH MEANS THAT THE CAPTAIN IS 
* ***SPARK MARMADUKE***
	* THIS FUCKIN GUY
	* the women vote sal as sacrificial lamb/lizard to deal with talking to him.
	* never mind it happens anyway
	* he doesn't remember us??
	* he's also got some floozy hanging on his arm
		* giant tiddy elf biddy
* is aurae a spy or someone trying to take advantage of spark?

# dawn of the second day
- spark has decided that we all need to earn our keep
	- sal to the boat duties, working for Boy
	- the women to the kitchen >:(
	- crel bucks the trend and sneaks up to the crow's nest to hide
- kay is supposed to do the inventory
	- annith gets out of it by pretending she can't count
	- but then annith has to spend time moving things around like a cavewoman
- sal tries to get info out of boy
	- to try to learn who aurae is, where she came from, how long she's been around
	- stopped by spark, momentarily
	- lots of people have been grumbling about the guest, but thinks the captain is rad and has a girl hanging off him
	- she's taking away time from him doing his actual duties
	- KID'S A VOYEUR
- crel tries to learn the same thing from the bosun
	- guy really just tells her the same stuff about aurae
- annith casts detect magic and tries to focus on her
	- doesn't detect anything
	- *does* detect magic in the doctor's room
- kaye talks directly to aurae
	- before yartar, doesn't remember much about it since she was on the boat
	- she might stick around longer than waterdeep "if the captain tolerates me"
	- plays dumb a lot, "i love that for you" energy
	- says she doesn't quite understand magic
- aurae seems to listen intently to everything kaye says about magic
	- annith is unsure if she's genuine
- boy catches us talking about aurae through the door
- Annith decides to cast alarm at night, is woken up a bunch of times in the night, never by a person.  must have been rats

# dawn of the third day
- same duties as yesterday, except annith is moving boxes for schmidt
	- she asks him if he's ever had to deal with spark's sexual misadventures: yes
	- she asks him if aurae is an oddity on the boat: no
	- ...ok
	- very awkward, spend the rest of the day in silence
- sal continues to talk to boy about his voyeurism and tells him stories about spark
	- i don't care about who you spy on as long as it's not us

# eve of the third day: "we may have shot you with a cannon by accident"
- while everyone is at dinner, we hear a shout from the bosun in the crow's nest and the ship comes to a sudden stop
- we've run aground
- it's a giant snake, like, a massive snake blocking the river
	- we're "pretty sure" it's dead
- we shoot it with a cannon
	- originally to scare it, but no spark shoots it
- it's not fucking dead
- it's a shapeshifter, a dwarf???
	- an unbelievably rotund dwarf, way too big to be a dwarf, but this thing is a dwarf
- spark makes kip fight it, it's not gonna be good
- sal tries to talk it out
- actually manages to talk him down, he leaves
	- "name's Rurik by the way"
	- he smashes a hole in the boat
- crew decides to sleep on the shore
	- annith stays behind to fix the ship
- sal sneaks back onto the ship while invisible into the captain's quarters
	- finds 3 magic items
		- pitcher
		- crossbow
		- amulet
	- checks aurae's trunk
		- full of women's clothing, *but not all the same size*
		- STILL STRONG SHAPESHIFTER VIBES
	- checks his documents
		- finds a doc that certifies us all as refugees of yartar
		- finds a mission doc: bland orders for supply logistics in yartar to get some inventories and talk to some officials, boring stuff.

# the next morning
- the captain looks off, confused and distraught
- aurae is missing
