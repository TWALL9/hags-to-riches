* back in caer koenig
* we received a letter asking for us to make a parade float for the spring festival
* BUT NOW WE FINALLY NEED A NAME
	* ***Magic Sack***
	* (Salphonse, Annith, Crelypsis, Kay)
	* "Your personal bag of tricks"
* we're going to throw enchanted magic bags of candy or something at the audience
* and "defeat Ib" to show our adventuring prowess
* craft brew will march in front with streamers or something

* we fix hoggers [[ep17 - do medusas multitask with snakes]] with a scroll of greater resto that we got from the [[ep28 - ancient tomb of ambiguous purpose]]
	* turns out she's a very wise hobbit-like hedgehog
	* she just wants to get out and wander and visit her brother
* hoggers also has a pet snail which is in her hat
	* this is the cutest thing ever

# easthaven parade setup
* we decide to take the whole crew, minus azaelia
	* ib
	* audre
	* bulakvir
	* BUT WE HAVE TO WATCH IB AT ALL TIMES FOR THE ***S P O O N***
* yann's family is here [[ep15 - I'm the faceless mask of life and death]]
* decide to start pub crawling here
	* inns are the:
	* big fat knucklehead
	* wet trout
	* white lady inn
* lots of taverns though
* white lady inn
	* stripper bar with some kind of white dragon lady/lizardfolk/dragonborn
		* named naxum
		* we should set her up with Sal
	* she compliments crel on her white complexion as well
	* the barkeep (siradius) also looks like a stripper 
		* like a blue tiefling
		* she notices that kay is a speaker (for caer koenig)
		* and annith has no idea of the repurcussions of letting it known that a speaker was at the strip club in the middle of the afternoon
	* this is basically the gay(mostly) bar in the town
		* considering annith is gae as fucc this is good
* the wet trout
	* it's a metal bar
	* a fuckin ***R I O T***
	* and it's the middle of the afternoon
	* Kay is OUT.  NO BUENO.  Crel is unpleased
	* Audre is IN.
	* the absolute LEGEND rocking the stage is boat captain himself LICK LARS [[ep09 - Yann and Yuan]]
	* run by a lady named sandy sparkle
	* Ib is out of control
	* PARTY GOBLIN
	* "such is life in the (mosh) pit"
	* turns out sandy sparkle used to be a pirate before "shit got fucked"
		* WHAT GOT FUCKED
		* SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ANNITH WHAT GOT FUCKED SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
*
