# The dragon in the flask
- the being in the flask was known as Thauglorimorgorus (aka Thauglor)
	- An ancient dragon and master hunter, his eye was taken after his death and suspended in this flask
	- Using it allows you to see whatever creature you want to but it acts as an anti-luck charm
	- we're keeping it wrapped up like a palantir and stuffed in the bag of holding
# They can be anything
- The fact that this castle is full of mimics is good enough for us to say that's where all the people disappeared to
- we told the town speaker in caer dinneval and they paid us, no big deal
# Ib is terrible
- Annith still hates ib
- especially after he put rat heads on spikes outside our home.
- there cannot be enough words to how much she doesn't like him
- he's better than annith at dragon chess...maybe.  both annith and ib lost to azaelia but annith didn't play ib out of fear of embarrassment
- Annith also reunited with audre.  the sex.
# back to bryn shambles
- we're virtually celebrities for our exploits...fending off crows?
- nobody knows about ib's magical ladle (the ***S P O O N***) despite asking around
- Same with azaelia's stone hedgehog.  she won't let it out of her sight and she's too afraid to show up in bryn shambles
- crel and kay start figuring out construction guilds for rebuilding the caer (it will cost 25k gp)
- annith and audre buy up a ton of old smiths' tools to build a castle forge in the caer
	- including a broken ancient dwarven anvil.  The thing is super rad and could probably be repaired with mending
# we got mail
- NEW JOB: FIND SOME SHITTY MINSTRELS AND CHASE THEM OUT OF TARGOS
- apparently it's some kind of atonal noise...maybe like the birds from [[ep12 - eldritch nonsense]]???
- atonal horns and oboe sounding thing.  nobody's actually seen whoever's playing them except for lights on the lake ice at night
- maybe mermaids?
- Plan on staying out on the lake until we hear the sounds because they're never present long enough to get up, get in a boat, and get out to them
- townsfolk are kind of sketched that we plan on staying out on the lake to wait for the...singers?
	- "you could fall in"
	- super sketch.
# i'm on a (rented) boat
- we managed to find the sound pretty quickly.
	- it's a kobold that's repairing two automatons
	- a demonic-looking teddy bear
	- and a giant amalgam of horns and pipes
- the kobold's name is scrappy.
	- he's "protecting" everyone by playing a noise louder than a resident siren
	- he's an artificer!
- he mentioned that someone named Oswald (another artificer) also lived in Targos...hundreds of years ago?
	- scrappy found his stash
- we're going to come back with craft brew (potentially upgraded for NAUTICAL WARFARE (CRAFT BOAT)) to fight this siren
