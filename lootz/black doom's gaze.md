The eye suspended in the hazy medium once belonged to an ancient black dragon named Thauglorimorgorus (a.k.a. Thauglor, Black Doom and King of Forest Country). Thauglor looked down on all of the intelligent races who, to him, appeared nothing more than meager meal. He always hunted live prey, leveling his disdain at any dragon who would stoop to scavenging. He lived to such great age that his black scales faded to a textured purple.  
  
Legendary Artifact, Requires attunement.  
  
Those who would dare attune to this artifact may perform an arcane ritual to direct Black Doom's Gaze to focus on a creature with which the user is familiar. While Black Doom's Gaze is focused in this way, it acts as an anti-luck catalyst, imposing the following unbreakable law.

  
"If something can go wrong, it will, and in spectacular fashion."  
  
In addition, the attuned person may see what the eye sees. When focused on a creature, Black Doom's Gaze stalks the target creature as a hunting dragon might.  
  
As a final note: This item resists magical divination. There is more to this artifact than can be revealed by simple magics, but those who try detect something sinister lurking below the surface...
