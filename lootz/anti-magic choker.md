Wondrous Item, Neck (requires attunement by a magic user)  
  
This 1" diameter golden bead can be attuned to by a creatures when it is held up against that creature's neck.  
Once attuned to, the bead extends a ring around the creatures neck and locks by magical means. The wearer cannot willing drop the attunement. Any creature attuned to this item is unable to cast spells or use any ability which relies on magic.  

  
The choker can be removed from the wearer with a successful dispel magic check, DC = 10 + the total caster level of the wearer. The spell suppresses the choker's magic for 1 minute, and the choker immediately withdraws the ring. A successful athletics check DC = 10 + twice the total caster level of the character will also be sufficient to break the ring. If the ring is broken in this way, the choker can not be used again until the next dawn
